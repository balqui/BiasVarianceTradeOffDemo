# BiasVarianceTradeOffDemo

Local usage: download or clone, keep folder brython_src and files 
index.html, DemoBVT.py together, and open index.html in browser.

Remote usage: do the same into some place that a web server can handle.

A simple demo of the bias-variance tradeoff using Brython.

Aesthetics to be taken care of some day.
